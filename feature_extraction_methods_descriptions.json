    "vgg16":"It can capture complex patterns and features in images. However, it has a high computational cost, so the execution time is relatively slow.",
    "mobilenet":"Although it may not be able to capture image features as accurately as more complex models like VGG16, its execution is considerably faster.",
    "color_histogram":"It does not capture relevant features such as texture and shape, but it may still uncover unique image clusters that are not detected by other methods. It usually makes more mistakes but its execution is very fast."
